For creating layout you need to learn GRID. 

https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp

All items are placed in that single column, one below the other, like a block layout. This is similar to display: block.
Display : grid
grid-column helps you control horizontal positioning of grid items. 
grid-column: start / end; or use span /2 
Span = cover


grid-column: 2 / 4; /* Starts at column 2 and ends before column 4 */
Grid-column: 1/ -1
grid-column: span 3; /* Spans across 3 columns starting from its default position */

What does max-content do? 
in a grid layout, when you use max-content in the grid-template-columns (or grid-template-rows), it defines the size of a column (or row) based on the maximum width of the content inside it without breaking the content.

Behavior of max-content
Definition: The column will be as wide as the longest unbreakable piece of content in that column (e.g., a long word, text, or an image), but no wider.
Impact: It ensures the content fits completely, but it won't shrink smaller than its longest content.
